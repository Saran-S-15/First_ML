Linear Regression Model for Predicting House Prices

Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict house prices based on the area (in square feet). Using Python libraries like numpy, pandas, and matplotlib, a dataset is analyzed and a regression model is built with the help of scikit-learn.

Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
	•	Area: The area of the house in square feet.
	•	Price: The corresponding price of the house in US dollars.

Example Data:

Area (sqrt ft)	Price (US$)
2600	550000
3000	565000
3200	610000
3600	680000
4000	725000

Implementation Steps
	1.	Data Preparation
	•	Import necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib).
	•	Load the dataset (price.csv) and remove unnecessary columns.
	•	Visualize the data with a scatter plot to observe the relationship between Area and Price.
	2.	Model Training
	•	Use LinearRegression from scikit-learn to fit the data.
	•	Calculate the slope (m) and intercept (c) of the regression line.
	3.	Prediction
	•	Predict prices for existing data points.
	•	Predict the price for a given area (e.g., 3700 square feet).
	4.	Visualization
	•	Plot the regression line over the scatter plot for better understanding.

Key Code Snippets

Import Libraries and Load Data

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

df = pd.read_csv('price.csv')
df = df.drop('S.No', axis=1)

Train the Model

reg = LinearRegression()
reg.fit(df[['Area']], df['Price'])

Make Predictions

area = 3700
predicted_price = reg.predict(np.array([[area]]))

Visualization

plt.xlabel('Area (sqrt ft)')
plt.ylabel('Price (US$)')
plt.scatter(df.Area, df.Price, color='red', marker='+')
plt.plot(df.Area, reg.predict(df[['Area']]), color='blue', linewidth=1)

Model Details
	1.	Regression Equation:
￼
	•	Slope (￼): 135.78767123
	•	Intercept (￼): 180616.43835616432
	2.	Example Prediction:
For an area of 3700 square feet:
￼
Predicted Price: $683,030.82

Results
	•	The model predicts house prices accurately based on the given area.
	•	Scatter plots and regression lines help visualize the relationship.

Future Enhancements
	•	Add more features to improve prediction accuracy (e.g., location, number of bedrooms).
	•	Evaluate the model using metrics like R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
	•	Implement polynomial regression for non-linear datasets.

Requirements
	•	Python 3.x
	•	Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

How to Run
	1.	Install the required libraries:

    1.  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
	2.	Run the Python script in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment.
	3.	View the results and plots generated by the model.
